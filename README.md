- Customizable UI with CSS styles.
- Session management to keep track of conversation history.
- Error handling for API responses.

## Requirements

- Python 3.7 or higher
- Streamlit
- Requests

You can install the required packages using pip:

```bash
pip install streamlit requests
```
Cloning the Repository
To clone this repository and use it as your own, follow these steps:

- Open your terminal (Command Prompt, PowerShell, or any terminal emulator).

- Navigate to the directory where you want to clone the repository.

- Run the following command to clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your_username/chatbot-gemini-ai.git
```
Replace your_username with your GitHub username and chatbot-gemini-ai with the actual repository name.

Navigate into the cloned directory:

```bash
cd chatbot-gemini-ai
```
Set up your API key using Streamlit's secrets management (see below).

## API Key
To use the Gemini AI API, you need an API key. Follow these steps to set up your API key using Streamlit's secrets management:

## How to Use Secrets Management

- Create a .streamlit directory in the root of your project if it doesn't already exist.
- Create a secrets.toml file inside the .streamlit directory. This file will store your API key securely. The structure of the file should look like this:
```toml
[general]
API_KEY = "your_actual_api_key_here"
```

Replace your_actual_api_key_here with your actual API key.

- Access the API key in your code using st.secrets["general"]["API_KEY"].
- This allows you to keep your API key private and not hard-coded in your source code.

## Running the Chatbot
To run the chatbot, navigate to the project directory in your terminal and execute the following command:

```bash
streamlit run your_script_name.py
```
Replace your_script_name.py with the name of your Python file containing the chatbot code.

## Usage
- Open your web browser and go to the URL provided by Streamlit (usually http://localhost:8501).
- Type your message in the input box and press Enter or click the "Send" button.
- The chatbot will respond with an answer generated by the Gemini AI model.
- You can clear the chat history by clicking the "Clear Chat" button.
## Customization
You can customize the appearance of the chatbot by modifying the CSS styles in the st.markdown section of the code. Feel free to change colors, fonts, and other styles to match your preferences.
- To run the chatbot, navigate to the project directory in your terminal and execute the following command:

```bash
streamlit run your_script_name.py
```
Replace your_script_name.py with the name of your Python file containing the chatbot code.
